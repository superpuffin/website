My name is Yorgos Bos, I am a biology student at Utrecht\r\n          University. I'm particularly interested in toxicology, cell biology\r\n          and to a lesser extend microbiology. In my spare time, I work for a\r\n          student deployment agency and an take active part in my students'\r\n          union. At my students' union, I was at the head of the cooking\r\n          committee and the cultural committee.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2 id=\"my-interests\">My interests</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Since I was a child I have had an interest in computers and\r\n          programming. So in my free time I try to explore this. To this purpose\r\n          I have learnt to program in the past few years. A key part in this was\r\n          having to learn R for my studies. This has led me to pursue coding\r\n          further, taking a Programming with Python{\" \"}\r\n          <a href=\"https://cursusplanner.uu.nl/course/BETA-B1PYT/2020/3\">\r\n            course\r\n          </a>{\" \"}\r\n          I also started tinkering with DIY boards like the Wemos D1 mini and\r\n          Raspberry Pi. This has yielded me a greater understanding of how\r\n          appliances work. Working with the Raspberry Pi has also given me\r\n          insight in working with Linux computers.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h2 id=\"recent-projects\">Recent projects</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          I've started some web development, for instance building this site.\r\n          Whilst doing this I've learned a lot. For instance using git and\r\n          jekyll. Also, I've started using Sass with this project.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </Layout>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
